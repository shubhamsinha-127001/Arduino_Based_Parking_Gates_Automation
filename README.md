# Arduino_Based_Parking_Gates_Automation



 This project aims to create a hardware-based parking prototype that automates the open and closing of the entry and exit gates of the private parking lots and reduces the dependency of human involvement to verify the authorised vehicles

Developed with the help of Arduino board, ESP32 cam, IR Sensors, OCR for Vechile verification and Python
